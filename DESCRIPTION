Description: Provides an R wrapper around the command-line tool guide-counter,
    developed by Fulcrum Genomics, for counting guide RNAs in sequencing reads based on
    a user-provided barcode library. This package enables integration of 'guide-counter'
    functionality into R workflows, facilitating processing and quantification of FASTQ files
    for CRISPR screening experiments. If you use guide-counter or this wrapper in your work,
    please cite the original tool as: Fennell and Homer (2022) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.6375792>.
